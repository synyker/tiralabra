The Text Collection

The choice of the types of texts to be indexed and experimented followed some basic considerations. First, we wished to cover a representative set of application areas where the problem of full-text indexing might be relevant, and for each of them selected texts freely available over the web. Second, we aimed at maintaining the number of these texts reasonably small in order to avoid long experiments and unreadable tables of results. In particular, we have only one text of each type. Finally, the size of the texts has been chosen large enough to make indexing relevant and compression apparent. Note however that experimenting may be performed at different scales, depending on users' RAM, by using the tool cut which allows one to limit the indexed text to any possible length (see below).

Follow the links of each type of text to reach a directory containing one gzipped file, <filename>.gz. Download and gunzip this file to get the original text file, <filename>. The directory also contains other files, named <filename>.<X>MB.gz. These are prefixes of <filename> of <X> megabytes. Of course, some of these files may not exist if <filename> is not long enough.

These are the current collections provided in the Pizza&Chili repository:

    SOURCES (source program code). This file is formed by C/Java source code obtained by concatenating all the .c, .h, .C and .java files of the linux-2.6.11.6 and gcc-4.0.0 distributions. Downloaded on June 9, 2005.

    PITCHES (MIDI pitch values). This file is a sequence of pitch values (bytes in 0-127, plus a few extra special values) obtained from a myriad of MIDI files freely available on Internet. The MIDI files were processed using semex 1.29 tool by Kjell Lemstrom, so as to convert them to IRP format. This is a human-readable tuple format, where the 5th column is the pitch value. Then the pitch values were coded in one byte each and concatenated. Downloaded during April 2005.

    PROTEINS (protein sequences). This file is a sequence of newline-separated protein sequences (without descriptions, just the bare proteins) obtained from the Swissprot database. Each of the 20 amino acids is coded as one uppercase letter. Updated on December 15, 2006.

    DNA (gene DNA sequences). This file is a sequence of newline-separated gene DNA sequences (without descriptions, just the bare DNA code) obtained from files 01hgp10 to 21hgp10, plus 0xhgp10 and 0yhgp10, from Gutenberg Project. Each of the 4 bases is coded as an uppercase letter A,G,C,T, and there are a few occurrences of other special characters. Downloaded on June 9, 2005.

    ENGLISH (english texts). This file is the concatenation of English text files selected from etext02 to etext05 collections of Gutenberg Project. We deleted the headers related to the project so as to leave just the real text. Downloaded on May 4, 2005.

    XML (structured text). This file is an XML that provides bibliographic information on major computer science journals and proceedings and it is obtained from dblp.uni-trier.de. Downloaded on September 27, 2005.

    You can also generate random files of any length and alphabet size via the program gentext detailed below.

To better understand the features of the files constituting the Pizza&Chili corpus, we provide below some statistics data about them. We remind the reader that the inverse probability of matching is one divided by the probability that two text characters chosen at random match. This is a measure of the effective alphabet size (on a uniformly distributed text, it is precisely the alphabet size).

Since we are dealing with compressed indexes it is useful to have a picture of the empirical entropy and compressibility of the available texts. Compression ratios are all expressed as the percentage of the compressed text size divided by size of the original text. In particular, Gzip (v.1.3.3) gives an idea of compressibility via dictionaries, Bzip2 (v.1.0.3) gives an idea of block-sorting compressibility, and PPMDi gives an idea of Partial-Match-based compressors. A copy of these compressors is available here. Since compressibility is related to kth order empirical entropy, we provide it as number of bits per input symbol and, in parentheses, as the corresponding compression ratio.

Compressibility measures related to empirical entropy. Hk stands for the empirical entropy of order k, measured in number of bits per input symbol and, in parentheses, the corresponding compression ratio. We also show the number of contexts of each order, which gives an idea of the cost to represent each model.
